* This folder contains an overview of convolutional neural networks in general, as well as a Python script for a basic image classifier.<br>
* The dataset used was the MIT Indoor Scenes classifier, an image library containing 67 different classes.<br>
* The model used was a sufficiently deep ResNet. However, I was unable to train it for enough time to post results (for now).<br>
